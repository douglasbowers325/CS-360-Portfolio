# StockFlow
For this project, this app was developed to manage and track inventory items for businesses, addressing the need for efficient inventory management and real-time tracking. This app also includes a login and signup page, a home screen that allows you to navigate through different types of inventory management, an inventory screen that displays all items in a grid view, an add inventory page that allows users to add items to the database, and a item detail page that allows users to add, subtract, or delete stock. It also supports user authentication, stock entry, stock updates, and real-time notifications. The UI was designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate by including a clean layout and accessible features, ensuring a seamless user experience. These designs were successful because they focused on simplicity, clarity, and responsiveness, catering to both novice and experienced users. The app was developed using modular and reusable code, with a focus on clean architecture and separation of concerns. Techniques like version control, code reviews, and continuous integration were employed. These strategies ensure maintainability and scalability, allowing for easy updates and feature additions in future projects. When testing the code, I would work in sections, testing after each implementation to ensure that everything was working. During the development process, innovative solutions were required to handle real-time data synchronization within the inventory database and offline functionality, overcoming challenges related to data consistency and integration. The inventory database shows knowledge and skill using and implementing SQL to add, delete, modify, and search for items.
